## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

What I would consider one of the main lessons is TAKE NOTES OF HELPFUL RESOURCES IN ORDER TO CREDIT THEM LATER. I failed at this during this project, but I will do my best to not repeat the mistake in the future. 

I had almost no previous experience using JS for web-development. I do, however, have intermediate knowledge of JS as a programming language and was able to build on that when looking for solutions to my problems. 
I learned a lot about how JS can be used to manipulate html and the term DOM (Document Object Model) now makes more sense. I know that my way of using JS in this project is probably not even close to optimal, but hopefully
I can build on the experiences from this project going forward. I am currently studying web-development and JS is the area of focus in the next couple of weeks and months. 

Other lessons learned: 

- How to make an interactive hamburger menu in JS/CSS. 
- How to access information in a JSON file and apply this to the html. 
- How to change parts of an HTML-document in order to make sliders and secondary nav-bars without changing the site url.
- That background blur is not as easy to apply as one might think, especially not in all browsers using the same code. 
- Be better at naming classes in css. 
- Be mindful of the structure in the css document so that I don't have to clean up so much at the end. 
- Many more that I cannot recall at the moment.
