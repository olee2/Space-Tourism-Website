# Frontend Mentor - Space tourism website solution

This is a solution to the [Space tourism website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript


### What I learned

What I would consider one of the main lessons is TAKE NOTES OF HELPFUL RESOURCES IN ORDER TO CREDIT THEM LATER. I failed at this during this project, but I will do my best to not repeat the mistake in the future. 

I had almost no previous experience using JS for web-development. I do, however, have intermediate knowledge of JS as a programming language and was able to build on that when looking for solutions to my problems. 
I learned a lot about how JS can be used to manipulate html and the term DOM (Document Object Model) now makes more sense. I know that my way of using JS in this project is probably not even close to optimal, but hopefully
I can build on the experiences from this project going forward. I am currently studying web-development and JS is the area of focus in the next couple of weeks and months. 

Other lessons learned: 

	- How to make an interactive hamburger menu in JS/CSS. 
	- How to access information in a JSON file and apply this to the html. 
	- How to change parts of an HTML-document in order to make sliders and secondary nav-bars without changing the site url.
	- That background blur is not as easy to apply as one might think, especially not in all browsers using the same code. 

And last but not least: To always make a plan before starting to code. I tend to just start in one end and go from there, not really taking future pages and parts into account. I write what I need there and then. It get's messy real quick. 
If I consider the design for desktop, tablet and mobile before deciding to use flexbox over grid, I might have saved me some agony. Just an example among many. 

This challenge was a collaboration between Frontend Mentor, Scrimba and Kevin Powell. Kevin's solution is available and I will now have a look at what he has done to develop the same site. There will be several lessons available for me there. 

## Acknowledgments

Parts of the code that I should have credited others for (but  have not, unfortunately, been able to relocate the sites):

	- All of the code for the function for reading the JSON-file. I found this several places online when trying to find the page where I found it, 
	so it seems to be a piece of code used by many. I wrote the functions that used this function to add the information to the HTML. 
	- The code and further information regarding the background blur in the navigation.
	- Parts of the code for the hamburger menu.
	- The code that adds the eventlistener to the destination nav, crew slider and technology slider.
